      <h1>About me:</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Caroline and I am an Integrative counsellor, offering a safe, compassionate
space for adults and teenagers to explore life’s challenges and find a way forward. My work
supports individuals facing issues such as trauma, anxiety, grief, loss, depression, ADHD,
parenting difficulties, adoption-related concerns and the many pressures that can feel
overwhelming at different stages of life. With empathy, respect and a non-judgmental
approach, I will work collaboratively with you to better understand their experiences, develop
coping strategies and build resilience. Whether you are navigating complex emotions, family
relationships, or personal transitions, counselling can provide the time and support needed to
feel heard, understood, and empowered.</p>
<h1>Training & experience:</h1>
<p>I am a counsellor who uses a range of techniques from different types of therapy to suit your
needs and circumstances. I have a diploma in Adlerian Counselling but use a variety of skills
from other modalities such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Human Givens. I work
with various ages, from adolescence through to adulthood. My training helps clients with
experiential learning, self-awareness and personal growth. I believe that a counselling
relationship should be based on equality, inclusiveness, respect and encouragement.
<strong>I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and
Psychotherapy (MBACP), adhering to their ethical frameworks and
committed to ongoing professional development.</strong></p>
